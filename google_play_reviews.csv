I'm opening my Evernote like usually and it asks me for a new login, then says your password is too weak and sends me new one with like 15 questions to answer. Really?!.. I do not have time for this noncense. And leave it to me to decide about my password. I need some information right now and instead of smooth work i have to let you know 4 last digits of my credit card, address,... This is nuts. All my friends moved from Evernote years ago, this is time for me to do the same",10.140.4,

If the developers needed that much money they could've just gone for an operation or just sit on the streets! Why ruin an absolutely gorgeous app and call it Made with Love! Bending Spoons... I hope your spoons not only get bent but broken in two in future!,,

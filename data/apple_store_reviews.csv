For many reasons to me, I mainly use it to write books, because of the fact that most book writing apps aren’t free, and if they are, they usually aren’t as good as this app is. 
I’m only 13 years old, but I’ve always loved writing, and drawing. So this app is perfect for me, and I also write song ideas down here. So I highly recommend this app to anyone and everyone!

When I open the app and click on a location to start typing the interface defaults to “drawing mode” instead of “typing mode”. I don’t like this because I don’t use the drawing feature. This is a new bug to me.

Also, when back spacing the typing cursor will disappear when encountering a new line. The cursor disappearing will cause the keyboard to not accept input, so cannot type or continue to back space. The cursor will not reappear until I tap the next line. The result is I cannot back space delete lines unless I tap each line.

One thing not included that I liked from a different note app was a note or notebook count at the top of each notebook level. The type of writings and note creation I do would find that useful.

Another thing I personally would find useful is to be able to change the top level notebook name within the app at the notebook level rather than having to go to a folder to make that change. It is nice to reorganize in a single place rather than separate locations.

Apple App Store,Evernote,MakikiGirl,12/11/25 17:30,4,"UPDATE 6/10/25: 
Again Evernote is asking me for another review. In my experience nothing has changed from my last review. So I gather they have been improving functions but none of them are improving my experience noticeably. 

I’ve been using Evernote for many, many years. I stand by my prior reviews, they still want us to watch their awful videos in spite of the fact we go into this app to paste a note. MY work and focus has to be interrupted by THEIR need for appreciation. At least we’re not led directly into YouTube like we used to be. 

The outline numbers still are not fixed and when I add a line the outline numbers all turn into 1’s. My clipper still doesn’t work on my Mac hence having to copy/paste. Back to the ‘90’s.

I have to learn Google Drive since that’s what people I work with are using. I wonder if they’ll appreciate my usage more than my longstanding storage app that keeps wanting me to appreciate them without giving me what I want. 


UPDATE 1/22/25: 
As a long time user of Evernote I feel obligated to respond to their request to leave a review. 

I will add one of the stars I deducted last year. They are trying to improve. It’s not as clunky as it became a few years ago. It keeps my notes where I put them and helps me organize them better than other storage options I’ve tried. 

I still have trouble with searching but I get better hits than before. Still not seamless though. 

I dislike being “made to watch” their videos of things they improved by putting a big block to read their notification. I’m your customer, not someone else. If you fix something important to me I will be happy using your product. 

I’ve mentioned this before but let me be more clear:  I don’t want to watch a video about a technical fix.  If the guy who describes them doesn’t improve his communication skills I’m not going to watch his videos. I’m busy too. I went into Evernote to accomplish something important to me and having my attention repeatedly hijacked is making me cross. 

But I will give another star for improvements made and for continuing to try to make this a good app.

Now, can the outline numbers be fixed so they don’t all turn into 1’s and my clipper be made to work on my Mac?

UPDATE 11/22/24: 
I will give the Evernote folks a bit of benefit of doubt. They seem to be trying hard though it’s still in the direction of what they choose to provide. I’m not sure if they really consider what we users want. 

They have been making a lot of improvements, according to their documentation, but I am not seeing much of them. Note taking is a little smoother. Outline and bullet point levels are still clunky and don’t flow from one section to another. 

Instructional videos are still explained in a poorly communicated style. Sorry but if you are going to recommend we watch your videos, I an going to highly recommend whoever is going to explain the updates take Neurolinguistic Programming Trainer’s Training at least Part 1. Or some other professional speech training. 

—————

I used to love Evernote. I have been using it for more than 10 years. I like to use it to save screen shots of things I find online I want to research more on later or organize into a social media post. It works alright for this in a rudimentary way. I am also now using it to take notes as I don’t have Windows for my Mac. It’s not very good for this because I can’t organize the levels of ideas very well in outline format. The numbers and letters don’t track well into the next item on the same level. Sometimes it will want to make all my outline numbers “1” when they should be “2,” “3,” or whatever they should be. And they’ve tried to make us watch the update videos. With all due respect I hardly understand what that guy is saying. He is apparently a subject matter expert… I suggest he take a communication class, practice a bit and hopefully convey to the audience what he means to share. If we have to be trained in how to use a function or we can’t figure it out I think the process needs to have a user advocate. Sad that this app has been changing over the years into something less usable and less useful.",I used to love Evernote.

However, from a functionality standpoint, the experience is significantly lacking. During my evaluation on an iPad, I found the process of attaching photos to a note to be particularly frustrating. The method for adding images from the photo library is far from intuitive—I had to resort to searching google for instructions, which reflects a serious shortcoming in the app’s user experience.

I previously used Bear regularly a couple of years ago and recently decided to revisit it. Unfortunately, it falls short when compared to Apple Notes, both in terms of usability and overall value. The interface feels unnecessarily complicated, and its lack of intuitiveness is a major barrier to productivity. While the app performs well for basic note-taking, any attempt to go beyond that requires external help, which should not be the case in a well-designed product.

Apple App Store,Bear,mgaydash,3/12/26 17:30,2,"Bear is a nicely designed app that uses an unusual tagging structure for file organization. I think it will work well for many users looking for an Apple Notes replacement that uses plain text however, certain design decisions make it unusable for me. 

Bear doesn’t use a traditional hierarchy of directories for note organization but instead uses a tagging system that includes the option for nesting. Unfortunately, Bear doesn’t offer the ability to filter on multiple tags at once, which is to say constructing a query as simple as “tag1 AND tag2 AND tag3” can’t be handled in the UI without writing a string query. That’s a dealbreaker for me.

Previous review:

I am sick and tired of all these apps that claim to be free with “in-app purchases” that you think will be a reasonable $3 or $5 price tag for something simple like the basic ability to sync your writing across two devices (something Google notes does for FREE) only to discover after you’ve installed it that it’s SUBSCRIPTION based and will charge you $20 a year for something that should be a standard feature in a writing application! 

No, I will not subscribe. I will leave you negative feedback, delete the app, and avoid your company in the future until you catch on that users are NOT interested in paying multiple times for software. I’d have BOUGHT THIS APP OUTRIGHT if your prices were reasonable, but a $20 annual fee is absurd. After two years your app will cost TWICE what Scrivener does and have fewer features! 

Uninstalled and a complaint has been filed with the Apple Store that they stop showing subscription apps as “in-app purchases” and start showing them as “subscription-based fees” so I know not to waste my time downloading them.

PS: Scrivener, which has about twenty times the features of this app, is a one time fee of $25. Less if you get it during National Novel Writing Month. I bought that software without complaint on two platforms at full price because they were UP FRONT and HONEST about their pricing structure and it is WORTH it.",Not “in-app” purchase.

Apple App Store,Bear,whitericeman,3/31/26 17:30,3,"Many people love Bear for its clean design and flexible organization system. I’ve tried to force myself to love it, but after using it extensively, I've found that its approach to organizing notes, while innovative, creates unexpected problems that might not work for everyone, myself included.

Bear's tag-based system tries to free users from traditional folders, but this freedom comes with downsides. The app's flexible nature can make everything feel temporary and unstable - notes don't have a fixed place, and the organization system keeps shifting. This manifests in a couple of ways: 

1. Bear's notes feel like a needle in a haystack unless you know how to search for them. This goes against how many people prefer to use notes apps - sort of like sticky notes that will appear in places that are useful. Having to remember what you wrote down to find it defeats the purpose of writing it down in the first place.

2. The tag system, while powerful, can be confusing. Tags come and go based on use, which makes navigation unpredictable. This might work well for users who like organic organization, but it's frustrating for those who need consistent reference points. When your mental map of where things are keeps changing, it becomes harder to develop reliable habits for finding your notes.

One of the biggest issues for me personally is that each time you open Bear, it feels like starting over. When an app doesn't become more familiar over time, it's usually because it lacks the predictable patterns we need to develop muscle memory.

Bear's design highlights something important about note-taking: most users benefit from having both structure and flexibility. The app's commitment to tags-only organization forces users to choose between being organized or being flexible, when many would prefer both. Having some fixed organizational elements while allowing for flexible connections would better match how people naturally organize information.

Bear works well for people who think in connections rather than categories, like reorganizing their notes often, and are good at remembering keywords and content. However, it might not work for people who need visual reminders, want predictable organization, work with time-sensitive or location-specific notes, or want both structure and flexibility.

For Bear to work better for more people, it would need to find a way to offer both approaches rather than forcing users to pick one or the other.",Needles in a haystack

I have tons of notes in there, and even with the free version it does exactly what I need it to do. So then here comes the issue: I recently got a new iPad and wanted to copy the notes from my old iPad onto the new one (I have the app on all my devices, but because I have the free version, I just copy and transfer whatever I need to). I hadn’t had the chance to do that until today, so I had time to start new notes on this new device (including notes I take for my classes). I was under the assumption that restoring a backup would import all of the files that I saved a backup of on my old device. There was NO WARNING that my current notes would be deleted if I restored this data. I did not have a backup of the notes in my new device either. Again, this is a great app, but I can’t forgive the lack of warning that caused me to lose all those incredibly important notes, even if in hindsight “restoring” data implies overwriting it. Even your average video game does this kind of warning.
